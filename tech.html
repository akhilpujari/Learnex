        <h3>C PROGRAMMING</h3>
      <h4 >What is C?</h4>
      <p>It is a very powerful and general-purpose language used in programming.
        We can use C to develop software such as databases, operating systems, 
        compilers,<br> and many more. This programming language is excellent to learn
        for beginners in programming.</p>
       
       <h4>About C Programming</h4>
       <p>The C language is imperative, procedural, and general-purpose in nature, 
         developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972 at the Bell Telephone for developing
         the UNIX OS. <br>As of now, the C language is one of the most widely used computer
         languages along with Java, which is mostly used among modern programmers.</p>
       
       <h4>Why Learn C Programming Language?</h4>
       <p>This language is a must for those working professionals as well as students who want 
         to become established software engineers. Here are some of the key reasons <br>why you must
         learn the C language for the domain of software development:This language helps users
         comprehend a computer’s internal architecture. It assists you <br>in knowing how a computer
         would store information within and retrieve it.Learning other programming languages 
         becomes easier after learning C, such as Python,<br> Java, etc.A programmer who is 
         well-versed with the C language gets opportunities to work on various open-source projects.
         For instance, some of the very popular<br> projects (open-source) have been written using the C
         programming language, such as Python interpreter, Linux kernel, SQLite database, and many 
         more.</p>
         <h4>Identifiers</h4>
       <p>A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed<br> by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. </p>
       
       <h4>Different Data Type Values<br>The int data type can be 4 bytes/ 2 bytes.</h4>
       <p>Remembering the size of the int data type is very easy. The given size is generally equal to the 
         length of the word of the program’s execution environment.<br> In other words, int will be 2 bytes or
         16 bits in the case of an environment that is 16-bit. However, int will be 4 bytes or 32 bits
         in case of an environment that is 32-bit.</p>
       
       <h4>The char data type is 1 byte.</h4>
       <p>The size of the char data type is basically 8 bits or 1 byte. No variation would occur with
         different compilers and interpreters. It means that the type of compiler <br>or processor used will 
         have no effect on its size whatsoever.</p>
       
       <h4>The double data type is 8 bytes.</h4>
       <p>The size of the double data type is basically 64 bits or 8 bytes. It is capable of storing values
         that are comparatively double the size of the bytes that the float data <br>type can store.
         This is the reason why it is known as the double.When looking at the 64 bits in total, the program
         has 1 bit for the sake of sign representation, the exponent uses 11 bits, and it uses the remaining
         52 bits for the mantissa.This data type is capable of holding about 15-17 digits, both after and before
         the decimal of the data type.</p>
       
       <h4>The float data type is 4 bytes.</h4>
       <p>The size of the float data type is basically 32 bits or 4 bytes. The float data type is single-precision
         in nature, and we use it for holding the decimal values. It helps in the storage of various large values,
         but the float is comparatively faster than double. It is because double works with comparatively much 
         larger data values. Thus, it is slower comparatively.</p>
       
       <h4>Types of Operators in C</h4>
       <p>Various types of operators are available in the C language that helps a programmer in performing different types of operations. 
           We can handle different operations in a program using these types of operators:<br>
          *Relational Operators<br>
           *Arithmetic Operators<br>
           *Logical Operators<br>
        *Assignment Operators<br>
        *Bitwise Operators<br>
         *Misc Operators<br></p>
       <h4>Comments</h4>
       <p>
         Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the 
         characters */ as shown below −<br>
         /* my first program in C */<br>
         You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.</p>
       <h4> Storage Classes</h4>
       <p>A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the 
        type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program −<br>

                     *auto<br>
                     *register<br>
                     *static<br>
                     *extern</p>
      <h4> The auto Storage Class</h4>
       <p>
         The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.<br>
             {<br>   
                      int mount;<br>
                      auto int month;<br>
              }<br>The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, 
        i.e., local variables. </p>
      <h4>The register Storage Class</h4>
       <p>The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means 
            that the variable has a maximum size <br>equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator 
            applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).<br>
           {<br>
            register int  miles;<br>
            }<br>The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that 
          defining 'register' does not mean that<br> the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a 
               register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions. </p>    
       <h4>The static Storage Class</h4>
       <p>The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying <br>it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.The static modifier may<br> also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used <br>on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class</p>
       <h4>The extern Storage Class </h4>
       <p>The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot <br>be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.When you have multiple files and you define a global<br> variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. <br>Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function in another file.The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two<br> or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below</p>

      <h3>C++</h3>

      <h4>C++ Overview</h4>
      <p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.
C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</p>
      <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>
        C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development −<br>
          *Encapsulation<br>
          *Data hiding<br>
           *Inheritance<br>
           *Polymorphism<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Standard Libraries</h4>
      <p>Standard C++ consists of three important parts −The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types 
         and literals, etc.The C++ Standard Library <br>giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc. The Standard 
      Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.</p>
      
      <h4>The ANSI Standard</h4>
      <p>The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for Microsoft's compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac,<br> UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha.The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers support the ANSI standard.</p>

      <h4>C++ Data Types<br>Primitive Built-in Types</h4>
      <p>C++ offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user defined data types. Following table lists down 
            seven basic C++ data types −<br>
      *Integer<br>
       *Character<br>
       *Boolean<br>
*Floating Point<br>
*Double Floating Point<br>
*Valueless or Void<br>
*Wide Character</p>
      <h4>C++ Variables</h4>
      <p>Variables in C++ is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. 
  The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
   A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.</p>
      <h4>Rules For Declaring Variable</h4>
      <p>The name of the variable contains letters, digits, and underscores.<br>
The name of the variable is case sensitive (ex Arr and arr both are different variables).<br>
The name of the variable does not contain any whitespace and special characters (ex #,$,%,*, etc).<br>
All the variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_). <br>
We cannot used C++ keyword(ex float,double,class)as a variable name.</p>
      <h4>std::string class in C++</h4>
      <p>C++ has in its definition a way to represent a sequence of characters as an object of the class. This class is called std:: string. The string class stores the characters as a sequence of bytes with the functionality of allowing access to the single-byte character.</p>
      <h4>String Data Structure</h4>
      <p><b>What is String?</b><br>
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated<br>
        with a special character ‘\0’.
Below are some examples of strings:</p>
      <p><b>How String is represented in Memory?</b><br>In C, a string can be referred to either using a character pointer or as a character array. When strings are declared as character arrays, they are stored <br>like other types of arrays in C. For example, if str[] is an auto variable then the string is stored in the stack segment, if it’s a global or static variable then stored in the data segment, etc.</p>
      <h4>C++ Exceptions</h4>
      <p>When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error).</p>
      <h4>C++ try and catch</h4>
      <p>Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch:
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.</p>

      <h3>PYTHON</h3>
      <h4>What is Python?</h4>
      <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.
Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</p>
      <h4>Why Learn Python?</h4>
      <p>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language, which allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms. Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and the indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.
      </p>
      <h4>Python Operators</h4>
      <p>In Python programming, Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. In this article, we will look into different types of Python operators. <br>
OPERATORS: These are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.<br>
OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.</p>
     <p>Types of Operators in Python<br>
*Arithmetic Operators<br>
*Comparison Operators<br>
*Logical Operators<br>
*Bitwise Operators<br>
*Assignment Operators<br>
*Identity Operators and Membership Operators</p>
      <h4>Python | Set 3 (Strings, Lists, Tuples, Iterations)</h4>
      <p>Strings in Python: <br>
A string is a sequence of characters that can be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. It can be declared in python by using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple quotes. These quotes are not a part of a string, they define only starting and ending of the string.  Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed. Each element of the string can be accessed using indexing or slicing operations.</p>
